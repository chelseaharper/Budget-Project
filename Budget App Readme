Program to manage personal budgets with quickbooks style evaluation.

Program Design:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSACTION CLASS
A type of object that takes an amount, a description, a budget category, and a date and stores that data.

Knows about Categories (no other program specific items)

Used by Ledgers, possibly Budgets (If budgets exist)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACCOUNT CLASS
A type of object that takes a name and generates a Ledger. Contains a root category and a list of Transaction Schedules.

Knows about Ledgers, Categories, and TransactionSchedules (Will know about Budgets if Budgets exist)

Used by nothing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSACTIONSCHEDULE CLASS
A type of object that takes a transaction as template, a start date, and end date, and a frequency. Stores that information as a blueprint for generating transactions within the account class list. Each schedule maintains a last run date

Knows about Transactions and Frequencies (Frequencies are a trait of Transaction Schedules despite being defined as separate classes)

Used by Accounts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY CLASS
A type of object that takes a name, goal, and parent and stores that information.

Knows about nothing

Used by Transactions and Accounts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEDGER CLASS
A type of object which takes a name. It stores a balance and a list of transactions.

Knows about Transactions

Used by Accounts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUDGET CLASS
***Class proposed, not yet implemented. Under evaluation***
A type of object similar to the Ledger class; may be a subclass. Would know about Categories and possibly Frequencies. Would store a list of transactions, but would also maintain a list of categories associated with various spending goals. All transactions would be treated as scheduled transactions.

Would know about Categories, Transactions, and Frequencies

Would be used by Accounts, maybe Ledgers? (if not used by Ledgers, would use Ledgers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project goals:
1. Track balance of accounts and spending trends over time
2. Run predictive cash flow analysis using future expenses and deposits
3. Store data on withdraws and deposits
4. Import bank statements
5. Compare intended budget to actual spending
6. Export documents of reports


Features to include:

Implement save and restore via file storing:
Create database of information using SQLite

Read/Write to Files:
Read CSV to import data from bank account
Run report on overspending for various categories (Excel?)
Run report on spending breakdowns within a category (Excel?)

Date Tracking/Trend Evaluations:
COMPLETED--Add recurring charges
Add functionality to generate a future predicting cash flow analysis from budget history
Store projected budget for categories and compare to actual numbers
Add automatic sorting into categories by expense description (Primarily for imported data)
Add custom keywords for automatic sorting

Data Visualization:
Add more types of usage charts (i.e., a deposits chart; a spending within category chart, etc.)

Database Use (SQL?):
Store data between uses
MAYBE: allow creation of different budgets and user selects which budget

Other:
Add custom budget categories (**Partially Implemented**)
Allow moving of expense from one category to another (i.e., instead of "transfer money to X Category" have a "Oh, this shirt was actually Gifts instead of Clothing" option)
